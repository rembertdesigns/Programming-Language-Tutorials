## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

### 🔍 **Quick Reference Lookup**
Each file is self-contained and organized by topic. Use your editor's search function (Ctrl/Cmd + F) to quickly find specific syntax or concepts:

```bash
# Example searches within files:
- "flexbox" in CSS.css for layout techniques
- "useState" in react.js for React state management
- "async/await" in JS.js for asynchronous programming
- "git branch" in GIT.txt for branching commands
```
