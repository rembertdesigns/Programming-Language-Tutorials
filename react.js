// REACT - Javascript Library - by Richard Rembert

// REACT FRAMEWORKS

// create-react-app -> 1st party; simple and basic; it is opinionated; many dependencies that could be useless
// next.js -> ssr or ssg; very fast; integrates best with Vercel hosting which costs
// gatsby -> very fast; plugins and themes available; hard to migrate; official gatsby hosting costs
// blitz -> not very established; good doc but not for migration; fast even with API query; needs a server (except on Vercel)
// redwood -> not very established; JAM stack; tricky migration; deploy everywhere; meant to be serverless
// remix -> very recent
