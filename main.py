# First Python script people use 
print("Hello, World!") 


# Primitive (Fundamental) Data Types:
# Primitive data types represent simple values. These data types are the most basic and essential units used to store and manipulate information in a program. They translate directly into low-level machine code.

# Primitive data types include:
String (str): Represents sequences of characters. Should be enclosed in quotes. Example: "Hello, Python!"
Integer (int): Represents whole numbers without decimals. Example: 42
Float (float): Represents numbers with decimals. Example: 3.14
Boolean (bool): Represents either True or False.

# String Example 
name = "John"
# Integer Example
age = 25 
# Float Example 
height = 1.75 
# Boolean Example
is_student = True
# Print variable values 
print("Name:", name) 
print("Age:", age) 
print("Height:", height)
print("Is student?", is_student)

#Output
Name: John
Age: 25
Height: 1.75
Is student? True
